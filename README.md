# T2VHE

This repository contains the implementation of the following paper:
> [**Rethinking Human Evaluation Protocol for Text-to-Video Models: Enhancing Reliability, Reproducibility, and Practicality**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05011)<br>
> The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (**NeurIPS**), 2024
> [Project page](https://ztlmememe.github.io/T2VHE.github.io/)

The overall framework of the proposed T2VHE:

The annotation interface with the dynamic evaluation algorithm can be run directly with the following command:

```
python app.py
```

We also provide HTML for static annotation tasks written based on AMT platform requirements.
